# Tonight, We Dine
A mod that allows players to change the exterior layout of 7-Dine via a config.

The layouts that can be chosen from are:
- V60
- V50 (Mod's default)
- Hybrid (V49's entrances with V50's terrain)

For best results, it is recommended that all players make sure their configs are set to the same layout.

This mod also has compatibility with [Chameleon](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/Chameleon/)'s fancy entrances option by [ButteryStancakes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/).
